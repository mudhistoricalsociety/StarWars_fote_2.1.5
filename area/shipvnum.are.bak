Turret Junction~
This area is the junction of the starboard and portside turret
rooms. Each side has 4 different stations to control the turbolasers.
While turbolasers power may be small compared to larger weapons
a small ship is only able to withstand so many hits.

one wall and a small sink against the opposite wall. The walls
here are grey and the floor is made of durasteel which makes
it extremely cold. There is a small window in the cell door
but it is controlled from the outside of the cell.
