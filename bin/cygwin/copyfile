#This little script is the major reason copyover for this mud is now possible

#I would just like to say thanks to whoever came up with the startup script enancement to tell the mud
#not to startup if the port was in use...I used thier Idea for part of this. 

# Setup working directory
cd ../bin
set wd = `pwd`
cd ../src

# Check if already running
   set matches = `ps ux | grep "$wd" | grep -c "swr"`
    if ( $matches >= 1 ) then
           # Already running
            mv ../bin/swr.exe ../bin/swr_old.exe || echo "Don't Worry, this probably means you've changed more stuff but haven't done a Copyover Yet!"
    endif
